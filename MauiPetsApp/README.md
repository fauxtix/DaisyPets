# Daisy Pets / Mobile üê∂üê±


- [Portuguese](./PORTUGUESE.MD)

A project for helping busy pet owners keep track of the daily, and long-term routine care of their pets.
It can also be used if you want to start a rescue operation and take them in as a temporary family host.

It uses C# as the development language, and was built using the .Net 8 platform.

Due to its simplicity, the SQLite database was chosen for data storage ([Structure](./MauiPets/Database/PetsDB.db.sql)). 

The ORM chosen to work with the database was Dapper, due to its ease of use and speed, especially in queries.

# Key Features

- Easy to use
- Record vaccinations, visits to the vet, applying dewormers and feed dosage;
- Alerts for vaccinations and deworming treatments that are due within 15 or 30 days.
- Expense management (with category and subcategory selection);
- ToDo lists management - manage important commitments such as vet appointments, medication administration, vaccinations, food purchases, and essential products, among others;
- Contact management, with an option to view the location on a map;
- App settings (reference tables, expense categories/subcategories);
- Log management (analysis and problem resolution) - with options to delete and send an e-mail with the generated error/alert.

# Technologies used

- **C#**
- .**NET 8 MAUI** - Framework for building cross-platform mobile applications for Android, iOS, MacOS and Windows;
- **SQLite** - Local database for storing the various objects/entities used in the app;
- **CommunityToolkit.Maui/MVVM** - Libraries to simplify the development of mobile applications with MAUI;
- **Serilog** - Library for logging information from any . NET application, which works with Sinks as a base.
  Serilog itself is a structure that allows us to store any type of information in an organised way during the execution of the application;
- **AutoMapper** - Library that performs the task of mapping one object (class) to another;
- **FluentValidation** - A library that allows programmers to create data validations quickly and easily.
  With it, we can use Lambda expressions to ‚Äòbuild validation rules‚Äô with error message returns for each property of the entities.

- ## üöÄ 1. Building the APK for your MAUI Project (.NET MAUI)

Follow these steps to build the APK file and install it on your Android device.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- .NET MAUI project targeting Android
- Android SDK and .NET MAUI workload installed

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step Guide

#### üü¢ 2.1 Ensure APK Package Format

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your main MAUI project (e.g., `MauiPets`).
2. Select **Properties**.
3. Go to **Android > Options** tab.
4. In the **Release** field, select **apk** (default is aab).
   - This ensures you‚Äôll generate an APK (installable), not an AAB (for Play Store).

---

#### üü¢ 2.2 Choose Deployment Target

1. In the Visual Studio toolbar, use the **Debug Target** drop-down to select **Android Emulators** and then your preferred emulator (or leave it for a physical device).

---

#### üü¢ 2.3 Select Release Configuration

1. In the toolbar, use the **Solution Configuration** drop-down to switch from **Debug** to **Release**.

---

#### üü¢ 2.4 Create Distribution Archive

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your main MAUI project.
2. Select **Publish...**.
3. Visual Studio will open the **Archive Manager** and begin archiving your APK.

---

#### üü¢ 2.5 Once Archive is Created, Distribute the APK

1. In **Archive Manager**, select the newly created archive when archiving is complete.
2. Click the **Distribute...** button.
3. In the **Distribute - Select Channel** dialog, select **Ad Hoc**.

---

#### üü¢ 2.6 Signing Identity (Keystore)

1. In the **Distribute - Signing Identity** dialog, click the **+** button to create a new signing identity (or **Import** to use an existing one).
2. In the **Create Android Keystore** dialog:
   - **Alias**: Enter a name for your key.
   - **Password**: Create and confirm a secure password.
   - **Validity**: Set how many years the key is valid.
   - **Full Name, Organization Unit, Organization, City or Locality, State or Province, Country Code**: Fill in the organization/owner info.
   - Click **Create**.
3. The keystore is saved at:  
   `C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Xamarin\Mono for Android\Keystore\{Alias}\{Alias}.keystore`

> **Important:**  
> The keystore and password are not saved with your Visual Studio solution. Back them up! Losing them means you can‚Äôt sign future versions with the same identity.

---

#### üü¢ 2.7 Select Identity and Save APK

1. Back in the **Distribute - Signing Identity** dialog, select your newly created signing identity.
2. Click **Save As...** to choose the location and filename for the APK.
3. Confirm the location and filename in the **Save As** dialog.

---

#### üü¢ 2.8 Enter Signing Password

1. When prompted by the **Signing Password** dialog, enter your keystore password and click **OK**.

---

#### üü¢ 2.9 Open the Distribution Folder

1. After publishing, in **Archive Manager**, click **Open Distribution** to open the folder containing your APK.

---

#### üü¢ 2.10 Transfer and Install on Device

1. Transfer the APK to your Android device (USB, email, cloud, etc.).
2. On Android, go to **Settings > Security**.
3. Enable **Install apps from unknown sources**.
4. In your file manager, locate the APK and tap to install.
5. Follow Android‚Äôs installation prompts.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Ad-Hoc APK is for manual/test distribution outside Play Store.
- Keystore and password are essential for future updates.
- The same APK can be installed on multiple devices.
- Always back up your keystore and password.

---

---

## ‚úÖ **Done!**

When you open the app for the first time, it will copy the empty database file to your device, as set up in your code.
